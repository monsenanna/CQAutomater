# CQAutomater

CQAutomater is a tool that runs in the background and automatically claims your miracles as soon as they are ready. It can also open the daily free chest, start battles with random person when your hourly battle is ready, automatically send a predefined lineup to beat DQ or run the calc to solve it and finally fight World Bosses.

### Public data
Since v4.5, CQA has been collecting data to help players browse history and do some statistics.
It's all here : http://dcouv.fr/cq.php

# v 4.9
New heroes (season & halloween), and some bugfixes / performance improvements.

# v 4.8.2a
Auto T1 and T2. It's in PvP tab, and if checked, it will build a decent-but-not-winning grid (my aim is 50-60% wr). Hopefully all alts use that and tourneys get more crowded.

# v 4.8.2
Bugfixes and G.A.M.E.S improvements.

# v 4.8.1
G.A.M.E.S and Space Journey basic features (in a new tab). No public captcha solver, sorry.

# v 4.7.5
Archers and Eternals.

# v 4.7.4b
Flash autojoin (betatest) : if you check Event/Flash, CQA will try sending a random grid to spend your daily charges. You will only be allowed to join if player count is between 20 and 50, and some flashes (different for each player) won't let you in, so that all autojoiners don't gather in the first 8 flashes.

Random grids are valid, use 10 heroes and 8 monsters, but don't expect top10 (unless you're very lucky). Also, first flashes of a day (not counting in the 8 limit) won't be joined.

The goal is to help alts and busy people fill flashes, benefiting everyone. I'll improve the feature if needed.

# v 4.7.4
Space journey heroes.

Version number will go red when you need to update CQA.

Added recycle counter (no auto-action, it's just a notice).

Cleaned SQL stuff so you don't need a Secret.cs anymore ; this also reduces exe size.

Several tweaks and bugfixes to improve performance and prevent crashes.

# v 4.7.2
Easter2020.

# v 4.7
P6.

# v 4.6
Xmas2019, flash data export.

# v 4.5.0.7
Feeding a shared sql database with PvP history, tournament grids, and userid-username connection. Ever wanted to know your neighbour's grid ? :)

# v 4.5.0.0
Events ok, subatomic heroes, personal PvP history.

# v 4.3.3.0

# v 3.2.1
Added Doyenne

# WARNING:
Auto-WB will work correctly only if you've enabled your username on website: https://cosmosquest.net/enable.php
I really don't recommend using auto-WB feature without username enabled as this will probably cause you to attack way too many times.

# How to get Authentication Ticket and Kong ID:

You can follow instructions from that thread: https://www.kongregate.com/forums/910715-cosmos-quest/topics/965457-cq-macro-creator-for-diceycles-calc
or
you can use the "new" method.
Add a new bookmark in your browser. In most browser you do that by right clicking on your bookmarks bar(CTRL+SHIFT+B if you can't see it) and choosing "Add Page". You can write anything in the "Name" field. In the "URL" field paste this:
>javascript:prompt('UserID:\n'+active_user.id()+'\n\nGameAuthToken:\n'+"Copy to clipboard: Ctrl+C, Enter", active_user.gameAuthToken());

Now make sure that currently selected tab in your browser is Kongregate with Cosmos Quest game and you are logged in. Click on the created bookmark and the windows should open with your KongID and Auth Ticket.

#### Don't share Authentication Ticket with anyone!

Now when you start a program for the first time and you don't have valid MacroSettings file, the program will ask if you need help with creating one. Just provide it with necessary info (for CQAutomater you only need KongID and AuthTicket, other settings are used only in CQMacroCreator), save them to file and restart the program.
